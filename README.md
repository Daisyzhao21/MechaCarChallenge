## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle and AWD provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set.

The slope is not equal to zero, since p-value, which is less than 0.05.

The linear model is effectively, because that R-squared value is 71%.Thus,71% of the time the model will predict mpg values correctly. There are probably other factors that were not captured in the data set that contribute to the mpg variability of the MechaCar prototypes.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

From the analysis, Lot one and two are both within the design specifications while Lot three exceeds  specifications.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
According to the T-Tests on Suspension Coils in Lot 2 the p-value is .607 which means there is evidence that the suspension coil is different from the population mean.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

I would study on key factors of purchasing a laptop since I just purchased one. I can use the test to see if my laptop is much different from competition on the market.
Factors for decision making including engine, brand,price. The null hypothesis would be there is no difference from the competition.The alternative hypothesis would be there is difference from the competition. To execute this test, i need to collect data from different types of competitor laptops.The T-test will be comparing the population of all types of competitor laptops.
